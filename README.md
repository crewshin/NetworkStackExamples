## This repo contains examples of ways to architect your app.

This repo is intended to showcase a couple different ways to properly architect an app with a network stack and unit tests. There are lots and lots of medium articles about how to use MVC, MVVM, Viper, etc in your app... but in my searching, not a lot of (any?) working examples to tinker with or study.

Feel free to checkout whichever branch you want to learn more about.


### Contribution:

Contribute if you think you have a clean technique.

* Fork
* Create branch (name it something like `examples/protocol-based-mvvm-[username if needed]`)
* Create pull request to merge into this repo. Let's keep the branch names intact so the PR shouldn't merge into `main`.

#### Things to keep in mind.

* Keep it as simple as possible so people can digest easily.
* Try and keep it to the single example in the main branch.
* Make sure to show off (update) how to unit test with your branch.
* If there are other key benefits of your example, feel free to step outside of these guidlines if needed.
